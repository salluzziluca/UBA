 In order to getting things done hay que definir 
 - What "done" means (outcome)
 - what doing looks like (action)
Es mejor bottom-up porque es mas facil ver lo que tenes que hacer YA que intetnar imaginar el horizonte, puede ser abru,ador


## Pasos 
We 
1. capture what has our attention; 
2. clarify what each item means and what to do about it; 
3. organize the results, which presents the options we 
4. reflect on, which we then choose to 
5. engage with

These are not arbitrary or purely theoretical suggestions—they are what we all do, anytime we want to bring something under control and stabilize it for productive action. If you’re planning to cook dinner for friends, but you come home and find the kitchen a total mess, how do you get on top of it? First you identify all the stuff that doesn’t belong where it is, the way it is (capture); you then determine what to keep and what to throw away (clarify); you put things where they need to go—back in the refrigerator, in the garbage, or in the sink (organize); you then check your recipe book, along with the ingredients and utensils you have (reflect); and you get started by putting butter in the pan to start melting (engage).
