An activity is sort of a big thing that people do – something that has lots of steps, and doesn’t always have a precise workflow. If I was building an email system (which I’d never be foolish enough to do) I might have an activity called: “managing email”, and “configuring email servers”, and “setting up out of office responses.”

A story for an “activity” might read: **As a consultant I want to manage my email so I can keep up with clients, colleagues, and friends**.

But that’s way too big of a story to put into an iteration or sprint.
