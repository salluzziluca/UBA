EXECUTIVE: How long do you think this project will take? We need to have this 
software ready in 3 months for a trade show. I can’t give you any more team 
members, so you’ll have to do the work with your current staff. Here’s a list of 
the features we’ll need. 
PROJECT LEAD: Let me make sure I understand what you’re asking for. Is it more 
important for us to deliver 100% of these features, or is it more important to 
have something ready for the trade show?
 EXECUTIVE: We have to have something ready for the trade show. We’d like to 
have 100% of those features if possible. 
PROJECT LEAD: I want to be sure I follow through on your priorities as best I can. 
If it turns out that we can’t deliver 100% of the features by the trade show, 
should we be ready to ship what we’ve got at trade show time, or should we plan 
to slip the ship date beyond the trade show? 
EXECUTIVE: We have to have something for the trade show, so if push comes to 
shove, we have to ship something, even if it isn’t 100% of what we want. 
PROJECT LEAD: OK, I’ll come up with a plan for delivering as many features as 
we can in the next 3 months.
