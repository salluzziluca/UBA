If we want to effectively identify the functionality of a system it is important that we focus on our users and their goals. A common way to represent these users is through ![[Persona|personas]]

## ## How we do it

1. Divide the team into pairs or triplets. Hand a template of personas (right) to each group.
2. Ask each group to create one persona, using the template as reference.
3. Each group presents their persona to the whole team.
4. Re-divide the team into different groups and repeat the above steps.
