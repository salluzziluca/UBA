## How we do it

Since we have already described the [[Persona|personas]] and the main objectives of the product, we can use the following activity to discover [[Feature|features]].

1. Put the product goals as column titles on a common [[feature]] canvas. Prioritize these goals from left to right, high to low.
2. Put the [[Persona|personas]] as row titles in priority order from top (high) to bottom (low).
3. Everyone suggests [[Feature|features]] and places them on the table. Use the [[Persona|personas]] and goals to guide the discussion. The key question is “what does the product need to do so that this [[persona]] reaches this goal”.
