At this point in the inception we should have two pieces of insight: a list of [[Feature|features]] that the product should have, and the display of [[User Journey|user journeys]] which indicate how users will interact with the product. With this activity we'll unite these two perspectives. Doing this will verify both of these views by integrating them.

## How we do it

Put the main journeys and the visible features side by side

Take each journey, and for each step, record any features that it needs.

When we're done, there's we usually find two kinds of missing links.

- Some journeys are missing features: for these we create feature cards, marking them for effort, value, and uncertainty.
- Some features are not mapped to journeys: we should challenge these features, do we really need them if they play no part in our users' journeys?
