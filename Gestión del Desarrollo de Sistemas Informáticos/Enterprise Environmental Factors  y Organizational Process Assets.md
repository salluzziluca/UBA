## Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)

First, we should understand “environment” before discussing enterprise environmental factors.

You can define the environment as anything related to the natural world and the impact of human activity or its condition, the culture that an individual lives in, and the people and institutions with whom they interact (Wikipedia).

Since we live in an environment, it influences our behavior in a certain way.

For instance, we must wear woolen clothes in cold weather to keep ourselves warm. The cold weather is the “environment” that forces us to cover ourselves with woolen clothes.

This is the impact of a cold environment on us.

Now, we come to enterprise environmental factors. 

Enterprise environmental factors are the influences not under the control of the organization or the project management team that affect the organization, the [project](https://pmstudycircle.com/project/), and its outcome. Every organization has to exist and work within the EEF.

These influences may have positive or negative impacts on your project constraints, though often, the impact is negative.

Enterprise environment factors can be either internal or external.

Examples of external enterprise environmental factors are as follows:

- Government regulations
- Market conditions
- External political conditions
- Industry standards
- Legal restrictions

A few examples of internal enterprise environmental factors include:

- Organizational culture
- Type of [organizational structure](https://pmstudycircle.com/what-is-a-functional-organization-structure/)
- Internal political conditions
- Available resources
- Infrastructure

## Organizational Process Assets (OPA)

Before moving on to the organizational process assets, let us define assets.

An asset is a useful or valuable entity or property owned by a person or company that has value and is available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies.

Assets are something that you can own, keep, and make use of at any point in time.

Examples of assets are numerous; you can have a car, which helps you move around, a house to live in, a computer to work on… the list is endless.

In the same way, [organizations](https://pmstudycircle.com/types-of-organizational-structure/) also have assets that help them achieve their goals. Here, these assets are called organizational process assets. These OPAs are inputs of almost all processes of the PMBOK Guide. The project management team may modify these OPAs according to their requirements.

Once the project has ended, these organizational process assets can be stored in a central repository to be used whenever required for future projects.

Organizational process assets can be divided into two categories.

The first is for processes, policies, and procedures for conducting work, which includes the following:

- Policies
- Procedures
- Standard templates
- General guidelines

The project management team cannot usually update or modify these elements, as the organization has provided them. However, a project manager can provide feedback or suggestions, and higher management can decide to update or modify.

The second category comprises the corporate knowledge base for storing and retrieving information. For example:

- [Risk register](https://pmstudycircle.com/risk-register/)
- [Lessons learned](https://pmstudycircle.com/lessons-learned/)
- [Stakeholder register](https://pmstudycircle.com/[[stakeholder]]-register-project-management/)
- Past project files
- Historical information

These organizational process assets influence the project’s success and keep growing as the organization grows.

Let us say that you are in the identify risks process. You decide to start identifying risks by using a checklist.

You will not create this checklist from scratch; you will look at similar past project records to find a risk checklist and customize it as per your project requirements. This will save you a lot of time.

There is a famous saying in project management, “Why reinvent the wheel?” which means if you have something available, why would you try to remake it? You are free to update or modify elements from this category.

Organizational process assets are used extensively in project management. The project management team is responsible for looking for any relevant documents in historical records before starting to build something from scratch.

### The Difference Between Organizational Process Assets and Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF Vs OPA)

There are many differences between organizational process assets and enterprise environmental factors.

Organizational process assets help organizations improve their processes, help project management teams to learn, and share best practices by using a collective knowledge base.

On the other hand, enterprise environmental factors may or may not help your organization. These are the conditions in which your organization has to work and do not fall under the control of the project management team.

For example, if the government increases taxes, it will affect your profits negatively; however, if they decrease taxes, your profits will increase.

Moreover, enterprise environmental factors are difficult to change; you must live with them. Organizational process assets can be customized according to suitability, making the project management team’s life much more comfortable.

It is important to note that organizational process assets always support the project team, while enterprise environmental factors can help or hinder it.

## Summary

Enterprise environmental factors (EEF) and organizational process assets (OPA) are the most widely referred to influences in the PMBOK Guide. EEFs provide a controlled environment where your organization lives and you complete your project. OPAs help you by providing all corporate knowledge, policies, procedures, etc.

You have to understand these influences as they are inputs of most processes, and you have to manage your project within them.
