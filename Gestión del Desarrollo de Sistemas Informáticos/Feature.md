>[!info] A feature is a description of an interaction of a user with the product or some other action that the product can perform. Examples include: print invoice, see detailed statement, and invite facebook friends.

The description of a feature should be as simple as possible. We start with something the user trying to do, we then consider a feature the product should have to support that task.
