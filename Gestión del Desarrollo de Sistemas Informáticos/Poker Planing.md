- Each participant gets a deck of estimation cards representing a sequence of numbers.  The most popular sequences involve doubling each card (0, ½, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) or the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.).  The Fibonacci sequence is generally more popular.
- The moderator presents one user story at a time to the team.
- The Product Owner (or equivalent role) answers any questions the team might have about the story.
- Each participant privately selects a card representing his or her estimate of the “size” for the user story.  Usually size represents a value taking into account time, risk, complexity and any other relevant factors.
- When everybody is ready with an estimate, all cards are presented simultaneously.
- If there is consensus on a particular number then the size is recorded and the team moves to the next story.
- In the (very likely) event that the estimates differ, the high and low estimators defend their estimates to the rest of the team.
- The group briefly debates the arguments
- A new round of estimation is made (steps 4 and 5 above).
- Continue until consensus has been reached and the moderator records the estimate.
