- Each participant gets a deck of estimation cards representing a sequence of numbers.  The most popular sequences involve doubling each card (0, ½, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) or the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.).  The Fibonacci sequence is generally more popular.
- The moderator presents one user story at a time to the team.
- The Product Owner (or equivalent role) answers any questions the team might have about the story.
- Each participant privately selects a card representing his or her estimate of the “size” for the user story.  Usually size represents a value taking into account time, risk, complexity and any other relevant factors.
- When everybody is ready with an estimate, all cards are presented simultaneously.
- If there is consensus on a particular number then the size is recorded and the team moves to the next story.
- In the (very likely) event that the estimates differ, the high and low estimators defend their estimates to the rest of the team.
- The group briefly debates the arguments
- A new round of estimation is made (steps 4 and 5 above).
- Continue until consensus has been reached and the moderator records the estimate.
- Repeat for all stories.

## Why poker planing? 
- Fosters collaboration by engaging entire team
- Creates consensus estimate rather than having a single person driving the estimate
- Exposes issues early through discussion of each user story

## Mejorías
**Those who actually could do the work are the ones that vote** (solo los que tengan idea del trabajo en cuestion)
**Managers don’t vote.** (van a votar bajo porque quieren que salga todo rapido)
**When there is a tie in the voting between two sizes which are consecutive, just pick the larger size and move on**
**Stop implementation discussions before they go too deep**(un poco está bien)
**Use an “I need a break” card.**
**Use a timer of some sort to limit discussion.**
**If consensus cannot be reached by the end of the third round of voting pick the largest size and move on**
**Have the person creating the user stories meet with QA and Development leads prior to playing planning poker** ( to make sure the user stories have answers to the most obvious questions the team will ask.  This allows the team to focus on the size, not spend time gathering information.)
**Remember the baseline.**(que siempre valgan lo mismo las diferentes cartas a travez de multiples poker plannings)
**Have fun!**!!!!!!!
