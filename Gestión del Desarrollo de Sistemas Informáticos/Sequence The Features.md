The purpose of aÂ [[Minium Viable Product]] is to create the simplest version of a product that we can use to validate a small set of assumptions about the product vision and it's role in a business. Now that we have a map of features integrated with user journeys, we are in a position to work out the MVP and the following increments. We do this by defining a Features Sequencer

## How we do it

1. Create the Features Sequencer template (typically a flipchart with numbered lines; the line height should fit one feature card, the line width should fit three feature cards).
2. Explain the feature sequencer rules.
3. Remind everyone about the activity goal: To define the sequence that we will deliver the features of the product. Our goal with an MVP is to learn from each iteration by building an MVP that will allow us to test if our business case is effective.
4. Everyone places the feature cards on the sequencer, moving them around as we explore the options, until we reach an agreement.
5. The result shows the features for the MVP and the product increemnts.
