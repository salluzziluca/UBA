## How we do it

1. Select a [[persona]].
2. Identify a goal for this [[persona]].
3. Write the [[persona]] and her goal on a post-it and place it on the top left side of a canvas (A3 paper or flipchart is best so it can be moved around).
4. Decide the starting point (helpful questions: how does the [[persona]] starts her day? What triggers the desire for achieving the goal?), write this starting point on a post-it and put it on the canvas.
5. Describe each following step on a post-it and place it next on the canvas. Continue placing steps until the [[persona]] achieves her goal
