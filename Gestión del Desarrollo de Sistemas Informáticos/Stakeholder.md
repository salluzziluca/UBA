The PMBOK Guide [describes a stakeholder](https://pmstudycircle.com/stakeholders-in-project-management-definition-and-types/) as an individual, group, or organization that may be affected by or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.

Put simply, if someone is interested in or is affected by your project, they are your stakeholder. 

Stakeholders include the project manager, [project sponsor](https://pmstudycircle.com/project-sponsor/), higher management, and team members. Stakeholders can be internal (e.g., employees and managers) or external (e.g., clients and regulatory bodies).
