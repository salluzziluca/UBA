Sometimes, it’s easier to describe something by saying what it _isn't_. This activity explores how we might explain the product this way, by asking specifically about each positive and negative aspect of the product.

## ## How we do it

1. Divide a white canvas or flipchart in four areas: Is / Is not / Does / Does not.
2. Write the name of the product above the quadrants.
3. Ask each participant to describe the product by putting post-its onto the corresponding areas.
4. Read and group similar notes.

This activity helps to explain the product. Afterwards the participants usually have formed a consensus view on what the product does as well as what the product doesn’t do. We can also clarify strategic decisions, such as things the product will never do.
