## Flat User Story Backlog dont work
Se hace un gran laburo para entender lo que el cliente quiere. Al final todo eso que aprendemos queda tirado a la basura porque lo minimizamos para quedarnos solo con la punta del iceberg que son las user stories

>[!quote] “We spend lots of time working with our customers. We work hard to understand their goals, their users, and the major parts of the system we could build. Then we finally get down to the details – the pieces of functionality we’d like to build. In my head a see a tree where the trunk is built from the goals or desired benefits that drive the system; big branches are users; the small branches and twigs are the capabilities they need; then finally the leaves are the user stories small enough to place into development iterations.”

I need that context in order for me to really tell a story about the system.

Es muy facil perderse y nunca lograr ver
