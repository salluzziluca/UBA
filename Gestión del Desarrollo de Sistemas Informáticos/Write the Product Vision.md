- For _[final client]_,
- whose _[problem that needs to be solved]_,
- the _[name of the product]_
- is a _[product category]_

1. Write the product vision template in a whiteboard or flipchart so that the whole team can see it easily.
2. Divide the team into smaller groups and ask each one to fill one blank slot (if the team is small, they can do more than one).
3. Gather the results of each group to form the final statement.

In this activity it's very common that the resulting sentence is senseless . Ergo, after doing the third step, get the team to work together to form a coherent sentence, using and altering the previous results as necessary
