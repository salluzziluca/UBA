## Routing 
The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as
they flow from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths
are referred to as routing algorithms. A routing algorithm would determine, for
example, the path along which packets flow from H1 to H2 in Figure 4.1. Routing
is implemented in the control plane of the network layer.
